Easy public vehicle lookup

## Description

This tool uses Seattle Government's public data API, located here: https://data.seattle.gov/City-Business/Active-Fleet-Complement/enxu-fgzb

Licenses are looked up in the dataset and if a vehicle is found, that data is displayed.

## Development

### If you just want to run the app

Build the image with `docker build -t <tag> .`. Run it with `docker run -p 5000:5000 <tag>`.

NOTE: If you are running this on an Apple machine, it is possible that TCP port 500 will be "in use" by the MacOS Control Center app, which is using it to listen for AirPlay. You can disable this by performing the following:
1. Open System Preferences>Sharing
2. Uncheck "AirPlay Receiver"

Alternatively you can use a different port if desired.

### If you want to make changes

1. Install a python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
4. Install the pre-commit hook: `pre-commit install`
5. Run the app: `cd src; FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run`
6. Make changes and contribute ðŸ™Œ
